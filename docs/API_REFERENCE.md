## AI & NLP

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/suggest` | Ask Claude to suggest field values from a narrative |

| `POST` | `/reports/batch-analyze` | Run NLP pipeline on all reports in bulk |
| `POST` | `/nlp/visualize` | Return annotated HTML visualization of NLP output |

### POST /suggest — Body

```json
{
  "report_id": "string",
  "narrative": "string",
  "fields": ["incident_date", "city", "coercion_present"]  // optional subset
}
```

## Import / Parsing

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/parse-bulletin` | Upload PDF/text bulletin; returns parsed field values |
| `POST` | `/parse-excel` | Upload Excel file; returns array of parsed incident rows |
| `POST` | `/check-duplicates` | Check a list of parsed incidents against existing records before import (see below) |
| `POST` | `/bulk-save` | Save an array of parsed incidents; silently skips exact duplicates |

### POST /check-duplicates — Detail

Accepts an array of `DupCheckItem` objects and returns a status for each before the analyst commits a bulk import.

**Request body:**
```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "raw_narrative": "string",
    "incident_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "city": "string"
  }
]
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "index": 0, "status": "exact", "matched_report_id": "RLA-...",
      "matched_info": { "incident_date": "2020-02-08", "city": "Vancouver", "narrative_preview": "Worker was picked up on foot…" }
    },
    {
      "index": 1, "status": "possible", "matched_report_id": "RLA-...",
      "matched_info": { "incident_date": "2019-12-15", "city": "Surrey", "narrative_preview": "…" }
    },
    { "index": 2, "status": "new" }
  ]
}
```

`matched_info` is included for all non-`new` results and contains the first 120 characters of the matched record's narrative plus its date and city. Used by `DupReviewModal` to show side-by-side previews without a second API call.

**Status values:**

| Status | How it is determined |
|---|---|
| `exact` | SHA-256 hash of the normalized narrative matches an existing `narrative_hash` — the text is identical |
| `possible` | Fuzzy narrative similarity ≥ 0.45 (max of Jaccard and overlap-coefficient, stopwords removed) against same-date candidates **or** same `incident_date` AND `city` (case-insensitive) as an existing report |
| `new` | No match found; safe to import |

**Match checks run in order (first match wins):**
1. **Exact hash** — SHA-256 of whitespace-normalized, lowercased narrative.
2. **Fuzzy narrative** — `max(Jaccard, overlap-coefficient)` ≥ 0.45 against existing reports with the same `incident_date` (or all reports if date is blank). The overlap coefficient (`|A∩B| / min(|A|,|B|)`) handles the PDF-vs-Excel case where the synopsis is topically a subset of a longer bulletin entry; Jaccard alone would be dragged down by the extra header/label words in the bulletin.
3. **Date + city fallback** — same `incident_date` AND `city` (case-insensitive). Catches lightly edited re-submissions when fuzzy text similarity is below threshold.

**Hash algorithm:** narrative is whitespace-normalized (`\s+` → single space, trimmed, lowercased) then SHA-256 encoded. This means trivial formatting differences (extra spaces, line breaks) are ignored, but any content change produces a different hash.

**`/bulk-save` behavior:** also runs the exact-hash check for each incident and silently skips any that already exist, returning `skipped: [report_id, ...]` in the response. "Possible" duplicates that the analyst approved in `DupReviewModal` are sent here and saved normally (no hash collision, so they pass through).
